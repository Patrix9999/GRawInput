# GRawInput
GRawInput is a modification for games "Gothic" and "Gothic 2" that change old deprecated DirectX7 Direct Input Keyboard and Mouse interface over native Windows Events.
It offers a way to enhance your experience with alt-tabbing the game and to make it easier to use ingame overlays like Steam Overlay or ReShade Overlay.

# Union Compatibility
GRawInput offers almost zero compatibility with Union Mouse wrapper that means if you want to use GRawInput wrapper you must ensure that Union Mouse wrapper is disabled you can do that by changing in SystemPack.ini "EnableWrapper = True" to "EnableWrapper = False".
